'''PyVows features an extensible assertion model with many useful functions,
as well as error reporting.

It’s always best to use the most specific assertion functions when testing a
value. You’ll get much better error reporting, because your intention is clearer.

This package contains all the code for preggy.

Aren't they convenient?
